<p> I first started out this assignment by looking for as many detailed building dimensions for the Empire State Building as I
could. After searching the internet for several hours, I still was only able to find relatively obscure architechtural blueprints.
</p><p> Here are some of the sites I found and referenced the most.<br>
<a href='http://www.esbnyc.com/sites/default/files/esb_fact_sheet_4_9_14_4.pdf' class='site'>esbnyc.com</a><br>
<a href='https://datavizblog.com/2014/02/11/architecture-the-empire-state-building/' class='site'>datavizblog.com</a><br>
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building' class='site'>wikipedia.org</a></p>
<p>Using the assortment of Lincoln Log sizes, which I found at <a href='http://www.knex.com/lincoln-logs-parts'>knex.com</a>,
I approximate I can use 128 logs to make a square foot. The total floor area of the Empire State Building not including the ground
floor is 2,684,701 sq ft. Which would mean I need 687,283,456 Lincoln Logs for the total floor area of the structure assuming the
floors are at least 2 feet thick throughout. It's 1252 ft. high (not including the antenna) and 187 ft. wide according to this
<a href='http://www.nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID073.htm'>site<a/>, giving each side an approximate area of 233,750 sq ft. Therefore,
 I would need 239,360,000 Lincoln Logs, assuming the walls are 2 feet thick(thinkness would certainly change through the building
 to keep structural integrity but I was unable to find any facts relating to wall thickness), to construct all four sides of the
 building. A rough estimate of the number of logs needed for the entire project would then be 926,643,456. Also, as a fun fact,
 the average price of an individual Lincoln Log is $.42 giving us $389,190,251.52 as a very rough estimate for the price of the
 construction materials. I'm sure, however, that we could work out some sort of bulk discount with Knex.</p> <p> Unfortunately
for our B-movie friend, were the architects of San Fransisco successfully able to raise this structure more than a few hundred feet,
this masterpiece would not be able to support the additional weight of any would be climbers, especially if the would be climber
weighs several tons. King Kong would therefore have to content himself with looking upon the structure and reminiscing of climbs
past during the summer months. Hopefully he isn't too upset by this.

<p>And if he is unhappy, hopefully his lovely lady will be able to distract him and stop him from causing any damage until he
returns to New York.</p>
